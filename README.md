## Summary

I used the provided API to implement the required functionalities. The book cards displayed the necessary information, but the author and genre data were unclear, so I skipped the genre and displayed the author's name instead. For the filter option, I utilized the book's subject, as the genre information was also unclear. Typically, a genre API or dataset is provided for filtering, but since no specific genre was available, I created a separate array using the book's subject for the filter option.
